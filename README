Cunia Notation
--------------

  Internally, erlcunia uses the so called cunia notation to represent music.
Cunia notation is a list of cunia events:

  Cunia = [CuniaEvent].
  CuniaEvent = {notes, [Note], Length} | {rest, Length}
  Note = integer(), {integer(), tie}
  Length = BaseLength | {tuplet, integer(), integer(), BaseLength}
  BaseLength = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 ...

  The tie length is added to the previous length of tied note.
  Second integer value in the tuplet value is the number of subdivisions in the 
BaseLength note. First integer value is the amount of those subdivisions to count for
the note length. For example, a quarter note triplet is represented as follows:
  {tuplet, 1, 3, 4}
and two swing eigth notes may be written as follows:
  {tuplet, 2, 3, 4} and {tuplet, 1, 3, 4}

  * Cunia examples:

  - [{notes, [10,20], 4}, {notes, [{10, tie}, 20], 8}, {rest, 8}, {rest, 4}, {notes, [10], 4}]
  - In priv/st_thomas.cunia file you can see a short study on Sonny Rollins's St Thomas
    standard. You can load it to the erlang shell by calling 
       {ok, [StThomas]} = file:consult(FileLocation)

  erlcunia.midi.player:play(Cunia) plays the Cunia using a external midi player. You can try it
with the previous examples. The first one is not very musical, but StThomas should play nice.

  Cunia notation is converted to midi with a intermediate step. In that step, Cunias are
translated to an "Event List". A event list is a list of tuples like {Event, Note, Pulse},
where:

  - Event is either note_on or note_off.
  - Note is the midi note (an integer).
  - Pulse is the time of the event in absolute pulse (they are translated to relative pulses
    in midi binaries).

  This list is ordered by Pulse, so midi translation is straightforward.

Lesson format
-------------

  One lesson is basically a list of relative cunias (first not is 0) paired with a to identify
each of them:

  Lesson = [{questions, [Question]}]
  Question = {Cunia, Tag}
  Tag = atom()

  The lesson player automatically transposes the relative cunia to a random pitch and plays
it in the cunia player.
