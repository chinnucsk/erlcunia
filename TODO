 * Write the documentation

 * Bad answer reply should be transposed in some cases. E.g. a minor
   triad in place of a major triad should replay one tone higher so the
   fifths (highest tone) match.

 * Unify names (questions, tests, tags, pitches, tones, ...)

 * Robust lesson player. Don't die on common errors (bad_file, bad_tag, ...)

 * Make midi player configurable
