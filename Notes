Cunia Notation
--------------

  Internally, erlcunia uses the so called cunia notation to represent music.
Cunia notation is a list of cunia events:

  Cunia = [CuniaEvent].
  CuniaEvent = {notes, [Note], Length} | {rest, Length}
  Note = integer(), {integer(), tie}
  Length = BaseLength | {tuplet, integer(), BaseLength}
  BaseLength = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 ...

  The tie length is added to the previous length of tied note.
  The integer value in the tuplet value is the number of subdivisions in the 
BaseLength note. For example, a quarter note triplet is represented as follows:
  {tuplet, 3, 4}

  * Cunia examples:

  - [{notes, [10,20], 4}, {notes, [{10, tie}, 20], 8}, {rest, 8}, {rest, 4}, {notes, [10], 4}]
  - In st_thomas.cunia file you can see a short study on Sonny Rollins's St Thomas standard.
    You can load it to the erlang shell by calling 
       {ok, [StThomas]} = file:consult(FileLocation)

  erlcunia.midi.player:play(Cunia) plays the Cunia using a external midi player.

  Cunia notation is converted to midi with a intermediate step. In that step, Cunias are
translated to an "Event List". A event list is a list of tuples like {Event, Note, Pulse},
where:

  - Event is either note_on or note_off.
  - Note is the midi note (an integer).
  - Pulse is the time of the event in absolute pulse (they are translated to relative pulses
    in midi binaries.

  This list is ordered by Pulse, so midi translation is straightforward.
